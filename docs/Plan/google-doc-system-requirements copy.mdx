## Functional Requirements

- User can edit / view the document
- User can see updates by peers on the same document immediately
- Users can see conflicts are resolved if they are editing the same part
- User can edit offline? Not necessary, but we'll discuss if there's time (like Google Docs)
- Is users' intention should be preserved?
- Do we need to support peer-to-peer?
- Do we need to quickly iterate?

<br /><br />

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. How many concurrent users should we support per document? 100 users like Google Docs?
2. What types of media should we support (images, videos, etc.)?
3. Do we need to support undo / redo?
4. Do we need to support version history?
