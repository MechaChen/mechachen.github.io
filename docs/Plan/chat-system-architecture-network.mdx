## Network

For chat system, we need to support real-time communication between users.

There are 2 main ways to support real-time communication:

1. Client-Server Model (WebSocket)
2. Peer-to-Peer (WebRTC)

<br /><br />

## Client-Server Model (WebSocket)

<br /><br />

The client server model is that we use a central server (or multiple servers) to handle all connections and collaborative behaviors.


<br />

### Pros and Cons

| Features | Rating | Description |
|------|:------:|------|
| Centralized source of truth | 游릭 | All users have the same document from single source |
| Scalability | 游릭 | Event hard to load balancing for Servers, comparing to peer-to-peer, only Server need to handle all connections |
| Implementation | 游릭 | Comparing to peer-to-peer, the concept is simpler |
| Single point of failure | 游댮 | Once server is down, all users cannot collaborate |
| Cost | 游댮 | We need a long live server to handle all connections, which is hard to maintain |
| Speed | 游댮 | Comparing to peer-to-peer, we need to go through server, which increase a network path |

<br /><br /><br />

## Peer-to-Peer (WebRTC)

<br /><br />

The peer-to-peer model is that only rely on clients themselves to handle all connections and collaborative behaviors.

<br />

### Pros and Cons

| Features | Rating | Description |
|------|:------:|------|
| Single point of failure | 游릭 | Even if any client is down, the other clients can still collaborate |
| Cost | 游릭 | We don't need a long live server to handle all connections, only rely on clients themselves |
| Speed | 游릭 | We can directly communicate with each client |
| Centralized source of truth | 游댮 | There is no centralized source of truth, each client is the authority |
| Scalability | 游댮 | When clients increase, every client have to handle more connections, which become a complex mesh |
| Implementation | 游댮 | The concept and implementation of peer-to-peer is way more complex than client-server model |


<br /><br />

## Network Conclusion : Which one to use?

Here are the pros and cons of each model:

| Features | 游끥 Client-Server Model | Peer-to-Peer Model |
|------|:------:|:------:|
| Single point of failure | 游댮 | 游릭 |
| Cost | 游댮 | 游릭 |
| Speed | 游댮 | 游릭 |
| Centralized source of truth 救넖잺救넖잺救넖잺 | 游릭 | 游댮 |
| Scalability | 游릭 | 游댮 |
| Implementation | 游릭 | 游댮 |


<br /><br />

Since what chat system requires is correctness, which can be achieved by centralized source of truth on server.
And Client-Server Model is easier to scale, **游끥 Client-Server Model will be our choice**.

<br /><br />

## Server vs Serverless architecture

About the server architecture, there are 2 main types:

1. Server庸뙥uild and maintain your own server
2. Serverless庸뙷se a third-party server (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure) to handle the server


<br />

And here are the pros and cons of each type:

| Features | 游끥 Server | Serverless |
|------|:------:|:------:|
| Long live protocols support 救넖잺救넖잺救넖잺 | 游릭 | 游리 |
| Cost | 游댮 | 游릭 |
| Scalability | 游릭 | 游댮 |
| Control | 游릭 | 游댮 |

<br /><br />

Since we need a long live server to have a better WebSocket support to execute real time communication, 
even Server Send Events to push new created room and last message to clients, which Serverless is not supported, **游끥 Server will be our choice**.
