- Network:
  - SSE to push room and last message
  - Share Connection Across Multiple Tabs: SharedWorker
  - Heartbeat to disconnect inactive connection
  - WebP / AVIF to reduce image size, good for preview but not good for download and following editing
- Performance:
  - Add Message Status, Support Optimistic Update and Failed Message Retry: Map Data Structure + IndexedDB
  - Virtual List to render message
  - Lazy Loading to render e.g. emoji picker, any popovers/modals
  - Cursor based optimization to load more messages
